## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Times delivery is crucial because
*it maintains client trust
*prevents cost overruns and resource wastage
*helps align with market opportunitiesand comprtitivr advantage
Ensuring dedlines are met
*clear planning
*regular tracking
*risk managment
*team communication

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

*accurate estimation
*budget  monitoring
*scope managment
*resource optimization

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
COMPARE AND CONTRAST
*Agile is flexible and interactive while Waterfall is linear and sequential
*agile is highly flexible while Waterfall flexibility is low and changes are costly and difficult
*agile offers frequent releases and continous feedback while Waterfall offers single releases after all phases are complete
MAIN ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EACH
AGILE;advantage,highly flexible
      ;disadvantage,can be hard to predict timelines and costs because the project evolves as it progresses
WATERFALL;advantage,clear structure
          ;disadvantage,inflexible to change 

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
AGILE;suitable forninnovative evolving products <example>developing a fitness app with evolving user feedback
WATERFALL;ideal for regulated high precision systems <example>building software for medical imaging devices with compliance key

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality assurance methods
*code reviews
*automated testing
*detect and fix integration bugs quickly
*ensure the final product aligms with user expectations
WHY HIGH STANDARDS MATTER;prevents costly,post release fixes, maintains reputation and boots customer satisfaction

           significance;mental health affects every aspect of life yet stigma and lack of resources prevent people from seeking help
           
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
*guides design and features
*ensures the product genuinly solves user pain points
*helps prioritize features based on impact and feasibility

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
my software can be a gental companion helping users navigate their emotions find moments of calm and celebrate their progress no matter how small 
it could offer comfort on tough days encouragment to keep going and a reminder that they are not alone whether its through journling mindfulness or connecting with other my sotware 
could inspire hope and make mental awarness a little more within reach

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
it offers a blend of thoughtful features that prioritize personalization accessibility and emotional connection

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
the global mental healthapp market was valued at approximately 6.1 billion
the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17.9%from 2025 to 2034

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
*staying competitive
